# tech-interview

A repo to share our technical interviewing process and collaborate on code with
candidates using VSCode.

We have dedicated guides for [interviewers](../docs/onix_interviewer.md) and
[candidates](../docs/candidate.md). Please read that (or both) prior to
conducting an interview or interviewing.

## Interview format

Our interviews are between 30 and 60 minutes, so time is of the essence! We try
to spend 10 - 15 minutes on each question while keeping flexible - some of the
best questions (even technical prompts) are open-ended and conversational.
Here's the general format:

1. Introductions (5 minutes)
2. Question 1 (10 - 15 minutes)
3. Question 2 (10 - 15 minutes)
4. Wrap up with questions from the candidate (5 minutes)

## Collaboration tools

1. [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) - for video and audio.
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - ideally using the Live Share
   functionality. This works either in-browser or locally installed.
3. [Excalidraw](excalidraw.com) - a collaborative whiteboard

## Motivation and inspiration

We know interviewing can be stressful and want the experience to be as smooth
and accessible as possible by making the process transparent. We hope this repo
helps you come prepared with what to expect.

Interviewing in a VSCode environment has been practiced at [github since
2021](https://github.blog/2021-12-16-technical-interviews-via-codespaces/) and
we think this environment is a great tool for demonstrating strong collaboration
skills.

We also acknowledge that the nature of software engineering is changing as AI
becomes a core tool in the developer's toolbox. We're exploring ways to bring
this reality into the interview process by making those tools available to
candidates.
