# Candidate guide

## Before the interview

1. Create a github account if you don't have one and show up signed in.
2. Read the [interviewer guide](./onix_interviewer.md) to understand what the
   interviewer is gauging.
3. If you haven't used [Google Meet](meet.google.com) before, launch the app,
   make sure your settings are working, and approve the needed permissions. If
   this is your first time using meet, present your screen - this may prompt you
   to allow browser access to your system which requires a browser restart.
4. (Optional) - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can be used in the
   browser if you don't want to install anything (press `.` when viewing the
   repo at github.com) but installing locally is a good option and gives you
   more flexibility over the settings.
5. Within your chosen VSCode environment, install the repo recommended
   extensions. A toast popup notification should notify you of this when you
   open the repo. This tends to make the editing experience smoother.

## During the interview

During the interview, you'll be given a link to join a VSCode Live Share
session. To join the session in the browser-based editor, simply follow the
link. If you want to attach your local VSCode environment, `Command palette >
Live Share: Join Collaboration Session` and paste the link. From the
browser-based editor, you can quickly switch to the desktop app by clicking the
status bar item on the far left that says `GitHub` and selecting `Continue
working in Remote Respository on VS Code Desktop`

## Tips

1. Take the call from a quiet, distraction-free environment. We know it's not
   always possible and things come up but try and set yourself up for success.
2. If possible, wear headphones - this helps prevent audio feedback.
3. Make sure your camera is on, your face is visible, and you're reasonably well
   lit. Seeing your face helps the interviewer gauge your communication skills.
4. Ask clarifying questions - especially for technical questions. Even if you
   think you know what the interviewer is asking, it's good to confirm your
   understanding and consider edge-cases.
5. Think about what makes software or a solution production-quality. Even if you
   can't build it in the time allotted, understand and try to articulate what
   the best possible version would look like.
6. Breathe. Relax. We want you to succeed and will do our best to make you feel
   comfortable. Good luck!
